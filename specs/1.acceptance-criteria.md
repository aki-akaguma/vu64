# Acceptance Criteria (EARS Format)

## U1: Variable-Length Encoding/Decoding for u64

*   **U1.1:** When a `u64` value is provided, the system shall encode it into a `vu64` byte representation.
*   **U1.2:** When a `vu64` byte representation is provided, the system shall decode it into a `u64` value.

## U2: Variable-Length Encoding/Decoding for i64

*   **U2.1:** When an `i64` value is provided, the system shall encode it into a `vi64` byte representation using zigzag encoding.
*   **U2.2:** When a `vi64` byte representation is provided, the system shall decode it into an `i64` value.

## U3: I/O Integration

*   **U3.1:** While the `io` feature is enabled, when reading from a stream, the system shall provide a method to read and decode a `vu64` or `vi64` value.
*   **U3.2:** While the `io` feature is enabled, when writing to a stream, the system shall provide a method to encode and write a `vu64` or `vi64` value.

## U4: No External Dependencies

*   **U4.1:** The system shall not have any external dependencies from `crates.io`.

## U5: Error Handling

*   **U5.1:** When decoding a `vu64` or `vi64` value, if the input is truncated or malformed, the system shall return an error.

## U6: Performance

*   **U6.1:** The system shall be efficient in its encoding and decoding operations.
